        <h1> Emphasis and strengthened text </h1>
        <p> This is a paragraph that has <strong> strong </strong> text, and <em> emphasized </em> text. I'm going to
            talk about how my <strong> UX205 Midterm </strong> went. To start off, with all my Midterms, I go in with an
            <em> open and calm </em> mind, and try not to freak out as much in fear that I will forget what I learned.
            What I was <strong> not </strong> expecting was the fact that there were a lot of short answer questions
            that took up most of my time! <strong> I have not written a test like that in years; </strong> where your
            hand actually starts to hurt. I feel confident that I did decent on the Midterm, and now I know that Dr.
            Goodrum's Midterms require a <em> lot </em> of writing!

    <section id="2">
        The reason why it is better to use <strong> strong </strong> and <em> emphasis </em> rather than i and b
        tags because strong and emphasis actually effect the content of the paragraph opposed to just changing the
        style of the text. It actually signifies that text is supposed to be more important than the rest of the
        text, whereas i and b tags just present the text differently.
