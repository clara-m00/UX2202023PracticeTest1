    <h1> Writing in Google Docs vs. Writing in HTML</h1>
    <h2> Whats the difference? </h2>

 <p> One of the key differences when it comes to writing in Google Docs vs. writing in HTML is the fact that layouts
of the respective programs have completely different UI. For instance Google Docs is made for word processing
and writing, there are different icons for specific buttons in the bar on top made for formatting documents.
Whereas writing in HTML, the coding service: Stackblitz is not necessarily used only for word processing and has
many different features and functions for coding in general. They are two different entities.

<br> <br>

Another key difference that adds onto the point of contrasting UIs, is that since Google Docs is made for word
processing, formatting the paragraph and sentences within the paragraphs can be easily done by clicking on a
button. For example if someone were to bold a word in Google Docs, all they have to do is highlight the word and
click on the bold button or use a simple short cut (command + b on mac, or ctrl + b for windows). When writing
in HTML formatting text is not as easy as clicking on a button. To format text in HTML, one would need to create
a style sheet, or use tags such as “strong” or “emphasis” to indicate any important text. In other words, you
manually input code to show the formatting you want for your text.

<br> <br>

To conclude, writing in Google Docs is very easy due to the fact that it is very visual, and the button already
does what you would like it to, meanwhile in HTML you must manually input code and type out tags and style
sheets to format the text.
